Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Operations on Data Structures.
The basic operations that are performed on data structures are as follows: Insertion: Insertion means addition of a new data element in a data structure.
Deletion: Deletion means removal of a data element from a data structure if it is found.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Compiler Design, Operating System, Database Management System, Statistical analysis package,Numerical Analysis,Graphics,Artificial Intelligence,Simulation
what is an Array?
An array, in the context of Java, is a dynamically-created object that serves as a container to hold constant number of values of the same type.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
First and Major difference between Array and ArrayList in Java is that Array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.
what is LinkedList?
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
In array, each element is independent and can be accessed using it's index value.
In case of a linked list, each node/element points to the next, previous, or maybe both nodes.
what is queue?
Java Queue is an interface available in java.util package and extends java.util.Collection interface.
what is stack?
Java Stack memory is used for execution of a thread.
They contain method specific values that are short-lived and references to other objects in the heap that are getting referred from the method.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
The difference between FIFO and LIFO results from the order in which changing unit costs are removed from inventory and become the cost of goods sold.
what is the order of complexity?
This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it.
Generally, the smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm, the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets
larger.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Declare a variable to hold the array. Create a new array object and assign it to the array variable. Store things in that array.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what do you mean?
what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.
A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.
what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
There are several differences between HashMap and Hashtable in Java: Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas: RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS – Array
Network data model – Graph
Hierarchical data model – Trees
How HashMap works in java?
HashMap in Java works on hashing principle.
When we call put method, hashcode method of the key object is called so that hash function of the map can find a bucket location to store value object,
which is actually an index of the internal array, known as the table.
HashMap in Java works on hashing principle.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Students should understand this error/exception when it occurs in a program. An object of this class is thrown when code accesses an array with an illegal index.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
How to Copy One Array to Another in Java
Here you will learn how to copy one array to another in Java.
There are mainly four different ways to copy all elements of one array into another array in Java.
1. Manually
2. Arrays.copyOf()
3. System.arraycopy()
4. Object.clone
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Difference between Array and Linked List.
Basically, an array is a set of similar data objects stored in sequential memory locations under a common heading or a variable name.
What is DFS and BFS?
The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS) are the two algorithms used for traversing and searching a node in a graph.
What is Recursion?
Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.
A method that uses this technique is recursive. Many programming problems can be solved only by recursion, and some problems that can be solved by other
techniques are better solved by recursion.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
In the linear data structure, the data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked one after the other.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Selection Sort Bubble Sort Insertion Sort Heap Sort Quick Sort Merge Sort Bucket Sort Radix Sort
